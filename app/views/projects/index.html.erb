    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hey! My name is Em and I love building things that live on the internet. I have worked in tech product teams for 3.5 years, wearing several different hats along the way. I've been a web analyst, content producer, business analyst and for the last 2 years I've worked as a UX designer. </p>
    <p>I learnt to code through a bootcamp with <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/london">Le Wagon</a> because I wanted to be able to build the things I design, and since then, I've loved every minute.</p>
    <p>Having worked at two large health charities (<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/">Cancer Research UK</a> and <a href="https://wellcome.org/">Wellcome Trust</a>), building products that have an impact on the lives of real people has always been really important to me. I love to focus on building experiences that are intuitive, accessible and based on insight from real users.</p>
    <p><b>I'm currently looking for a role as a junior developer.</b></p>
    <p>Here are a few of the technologies I've been working with recently.</p>
